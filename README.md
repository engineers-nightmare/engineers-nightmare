# Engineer's Nightmare [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/engineers-nightmare/engineers-nightmare.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/engineers-nightmare/engineers-nightmare)

Engineer's Nightmare (working title) is a multiplayer cooperative story-driven game where a team of players fight to keep a spaceship in working order while a DM tries to tear it apart.

Starting from scratch, or a partially pre-fabricated base, players will build a spaceship while fending off events generated by the DM. Such events might include warp core overload, or a hostile boarding party.

Centered on an engineer's point of view, Engineer's Nightmare provides a unique gameplay experience. Run miles of wiring, isolate critical systems to prevent cascading failures, expose yourself to hard vacuum. Join the Engineer's Corps today.
